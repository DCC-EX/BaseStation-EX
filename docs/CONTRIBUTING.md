Thanks for considering contributing to our project. Here is a guide for how to get started and and a list of our conventions. We will also walk you through the Github command line and Desktop commands necessary to download the code, make changes, and get it included in a next version of the sofware.

## Development Platform

We are using Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO. To get everything you need, follow these steps:

* Download and install the latest version of the Arduino IDE
* Download and install the latest version of Visual Studio Code from Microsoft
* Run VSCode and click on the "extensions" icon on the left. Install "PlatformIO IDE for VSCode" and the "Arduino Framework" support

If you don't see C/C++ Installed in the list, install that too. We also recomment installing the Gitlens extension to make working with Git and GitHub even easier.

## Code Formatting

We are using the "Visual Studio" C++ code formatting standard. Make sure in your VSCode Settings that the C_Cpp:Clang_format_fallback Style is set to "Visual Studio". Then when you right click and select "Format Document" (or use the Alt-Shift-F shortcut) your code will be standardized to the DCC++ EX style.
